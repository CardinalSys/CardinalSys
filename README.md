Hi, I'm @KuhakuGDev and I'm a C# program and game developer. I'm the creator of the Rainbow Six Siege Tracker with reverse engineering for TinoRed on Cuba (its a intranet). I have on my github repositories some of my games prototypes in Unity.

Also I have knows of programming on Ren'py, C++ and Python. (Yes ... I know that the programming language used in Ren'py is python, but it is not the same thing xd)

P.d: I speak: english, spanish and italian.
