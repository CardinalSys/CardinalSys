Hi, I'm @KuhakuGDev and I'm a C# program developer on WinForm and Console, and a game developer on Unity and Unreal Engine. I'm created the Rainbow Six Siege Tracker with reverse engineering for TinoRed on Cuba (its a intranet). I have on my github repositories some of my games prototypes in Unity (I can't upload de Unreal Engine prototypes cause they size are bigger than my wallet, I love you Etecsa).

Also I have knows of programming on Ren'py, C++, Python and fronted development.

My most important repository is private (R6 tracker)

P.d: I speak: english, spanish and italian.
